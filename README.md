# Obesity Paradox

## Research Questions
In this research, we would to examine how the BMI rate affects mortality
in an immediate period (0-6 months), after one year and five years from the moment of hospitalization, among patients with infectious disease who were hospitalized in the various wards.
Secondly, we would like to check the effects of BMI on hospitalization outcomes, such as: duration of hospitalization.
In addition, we will examine which confounding variables may affect the obesity paradox, for example: age, gender and amount of amount of albumin in the blood (a common protein).

## Useful
Understanding the association of obesity with survival after acute hospitalization is important for focused treatment of the patient according to his BMI.

1. Functions:
The functions we wrote and used during the research

2. Analysis of the main research question - what is the association between BMI and mortality for different time horizons.
We examined the effect of BMI, age and gender on hospitalization mortality in three time frames -
Immediate time (up to 3 months), 1 year and 5 years.
We used 3 different analysis methods:

   -  Logistic regression on continuous BMI
   - Logistic regression on BMI groups
   - Survival analysis
   
3. Analysis of the second research question - what is the association of BMI and additional hospitalization outcomes:
We examined the effect of BMI, age and gender on additional hospitalization outcomes such as the duration of hospitalization and occurrence of re-hospitalizations.

4. Analysis of confounding variables
We examined through logistic regression whether there are confounding variables such as background diseases, infectious diseases and measurement variables.
